        Write the content of a resume in YAML format. The YAML should:
        
        1. Include all the sections that are required by rendercv as specified in their docs.
        2. Format it in yaml format.
        3. Ensure it follows rendercv guidelines for creating the yaml.
        4. Format the content professionally and concisely.
        6. wrap each fields content in double quotes. so that its a valid yaml.
        7. Use proper YAML syntax for keys and values.
        8. Ensure the output is valid YAML that can be converted to a PDF using rendercv.
        9. Make the content suitable for the given job description.
        10. In the skills section, include the skills as a string of comma-separated values.
        11. Keep the content highly concise so that the rendered pdf has only 1 page.
        12. Make sure to include the all the details from candidates reusme correctly especially the education sections. 

        below is the schema of rendercv's requeired fields in the yaml file

        cv:

        ...
        design:
            theme: classic 
            

        stricly use the following JSON schema for the cv section to generate the yaml:
        {cv_schema}
